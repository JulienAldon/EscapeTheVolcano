# Escape the volcano
This game has been designed during GameDesign lessons during my first year of master in St-Petersburg.

I decided to code the game because I thought the idea was nice and simple to realize as a first game. It wasn't...

I firstly made it in Python but the engine I coded wasn't optimized enough so a lot of functionnality were not possible. I decided to use an easy tool and more powerfull than python to develop the game, so i turned myself toward Unity.

I learned a lot of things about game design and game developpement in c# and using Unity.
