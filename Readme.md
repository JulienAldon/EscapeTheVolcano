# Escape the volcano
This game has been designed during GameDesign lessons during my first year of master in St-Petersburg

I decided to code the game because I thought the idea was nice and simple to realize as a first game.
It wasn't...

I learned a lot of things about game design and game developpement in c# and using Unity.

# How to play
This section will be removed when a proper tutorial will be in the game.

There is only 3 major keys:
- Action (Default `A`)
- Fire (Default `E`)
- Switch (Default `Z`)

And of course moving is binded by default on `arrow keys` and `space`
