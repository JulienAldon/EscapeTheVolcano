# Escape the volcano
This game has been designed during GameDesign lessons during my first year of master in St-Petersburg

I decided to code the game because I thought the idea was nice and simple to realize as a first game.
It wasn't...

I learned a lot of things about game design and game developpement in c# and using Unity.
